1) for the logging part i would create a logger and pass it to elasticsearch and set it to receive logs from info,
warning and error that way we will log all requests in addition we will add to each log the current user and a timestamp.
We can create another elasticsearch db for the logs and when we search it for a user we could see all his actions
and order it by the timestamp to see the order of his actions (api requests).
With a log elasticsearch db we can run queries for analytics with simple access, this db could be shared between the multiple instances of the server.

2)in a larger scale i would create a queue for requests and worker nodes who take each request run them and return the response.
I would also create a caching mechanism for each user based on his searches to improve response time and lower the amount of requests in the queue.
And finally I would turn my single node elasticsearch to a cluster and balance the workers and the nodes in the cluster to optimize the response time.
